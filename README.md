## Property Valuation
This project aims to determine property prices using machine learning algorithms based on property features scraped from MagicBricks website listings. The process involves scraping property information, data cleaning, preprocessing, and model training.

## Files Included:
* ***Data_with_predictions.csv***: This file contains property information along with the predicted price per square foot obtained from machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.

* ***scraped_df.csv***: Contains raw scraped data retrieved from the MagicBricks website, including details for approximately 3000 property cards. This dataset serves as the initial data source for analysis.

* ***clean_df.csv***: This file contains the cleaned and preprocessed data derived from the scraped data. The cleaning process involved handling missing values, feature engineering, and formatting the dataset for modeling.

## Technologies Used  
* ***Selenium***: Web automation tool for data extraction.
* ***BeautifulSoup***: Python library for HTML parsing.
* ***Scikit-Learn***: Machine learning library for predictive modeling

## Process
* ***Scraping***: The data collection process involved web scraping MagicBricks to gather property listings, capturing information such as property type, location, size, and price. The resulting data was saved in *scraped_df.csv*.

* ***Data Cleaning and Preprocessing***: The scraped data underwent thorough cleaning to handle missing values, eliminate duplicates, and preprocess features to prepare it for model training. This stage resulted in the *'clean_df.csv'* dataset.

* ***Model Training***: Three machine learning modelsâ€” *Linear Regression*, *Decision Trees*, and *Random Forest* were employed to predict property prices per square foot based on various property features. The predictions were appended to the *'Data_with_predictions.csv'* file.

* ***Results***: The 'Data_with_predictions.csv' file contains property details along with predicted price per square foot generated by the trained machine learning models.

## Getting started
To get started with the project:
* Clone the repository: git clone
* Install the project dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
* Run the *scraper.py* file and let the script scrape the data for the properties. It will scrape 3000 properties as default.
* Run *cleaning.py* to clean and process the data for the next steps.
* Run *main.py* file to train the data with machine learning models.
